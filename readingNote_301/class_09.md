## What is functional programming?

#### In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.



## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

#### Pure Functions A pure function is a function which: Given the same input, will always return the same output. Produces no side effects

-----------

## What are the benefits of a pure function?

## * Benefits of pure functions: *

- They’re easier to reason about
- They’re easier to combine
- They’re easier to test
- They’re easier to debug
- They’re easier to parallelize

## What is immutability 

### Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

## What is Referential transparency 
- 'pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency'

### What does the word ‘require’ do?
