## Reasons for Pair Programming

- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

- For me i see the most benefit of the pair programming is the grater efficiency and the engaged collabration and the learning from fellow students, because i believe that two mind work completly different from only one so while working on pair programming the way we solve the problems is different we think together and discuss the code toogether and that add to us new things that we catch it from each other. And it's make the work more fun and exciting.


### How does pair programming work?

- It's work by two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
