## Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:



- SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

- For DB types: On a high-level, we can classify SQL databases as either open-source or close-sourced from commercial vendors. NoSQL databases can be classified on the basis of way of storing data as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases.

- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

- For properties: SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.



## Give a real world example.

- **MS-SQL Server Express Edition It is a powerful and user friendly database which has good stability, reliability and scalability with support from Microsoft. The following are some of MS-SQL benefits and strengths:**

- Cloud back-up
- Integrated Development Environment
- Disaster Recovery


## A real world example(NoSQL):

- Dynamic Schema
- Manageable
- Speed



SQL | NoSQL databases:
------- | ----------
Relational Databases (RDBMS) | non-relational or distributed database
scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware | 	scaled by increasing the databases servers
predefined schema	| dynamic schema for unstructured data
vertically scalable | horizontally scalable
uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | UnQL (Unstructured Query Language)
table based | document based, key-value pairs, graph
SQL examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL| UnQL examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb


### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
- complex query intensive environment

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
- Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema.

### Give a real world example.
- MySQL Microsoft visual studio, Sql Server , gaming


### Which type of database is best for scalability?
- NoSQL

### SQL stand for:
- Structured Query Language
