## JavaScript Objects

#### We have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.

#### Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

#### JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.

### Object Properties
#### The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:

Property | Property Value
------ | -------
firstName | John
lastName | Doe
age | 50
eyeColor | blue

## Document Object Model

#### With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

- JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
- JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
- JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
- JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
- JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

#### When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a ** D **ocument ** O **bject ** M **odel of the page.

The ** HTML DOM ** model is constructed as a tree of Objects

### What is the DOM?

#### The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

#### The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

*** "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document." ***

#### ** The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts: **

1. Core DOM - standard model for all document types
2. XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
3. HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

### What is the HTML DOM?

#### The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

- The HTML elements as objects
- The properties of all HTML elements
- The methods to access all HTML elements
- The events for all HTML elements

### ** In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements. **
