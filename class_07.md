#### HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.

### The < table > tag defines an HTML table.

#### Each table row is defined with a < tr > tag. Each table header is defined with a <th> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a < td > tag.

#### By default, the text in < th > elements are bold and centered.

#### By default, the text in < td > elements are regular and left-aligned.

#### Cell padding specifies the space between the cell content and its borders.
 
#### If you do not specify a padding, the table cells will be displayed without padding.

### Functions, Methods, and Objects

#### A method is a function associated with an object, or, put differently, a method is a property of an object that is a function. Methods are defined the way normal functions are defined, except that they have to be assigned as the property of an object.

### Conclusion 

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.

- Functions can take parameters   (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.

- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.

- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.

- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.

- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

- Arrays and objects can be used to reate complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
