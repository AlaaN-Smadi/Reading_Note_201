![Links](https://i.dlpng.com/static/png/7183819_preview.png)

#### HTML links are hyperlinks.

#### You can click on a link and jump to another document.

#### When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

### By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

- An unvisited link is underlined and blue
- A visited link is underlined and purple
- An active link is underlined and red


Element | uses
----- | -----
< a > | define a link
href | define the link address
target | define where to open the linked document
< img > element (inside < a >) | to use an image as a link
mailto: scheme inside the href attribute | create a link that opens the user's email program

![LayOut](https://data-flair.training/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/HTML-Layout-df.jpg)

#### Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or a newspaper).

### HTML Layout Elements

- < header > - Defines a header for a document or a section
- < nav > - Defines a set of navigation links
- < section > - Defines a section in a document
- < article > - Defines an independent, self-contained content
- < aside > - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- < footer > - Defines a footer for a document or a section
- < details > - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
- < summary > - Defines a heading for the < details > element

### HTML Layout Techniques

#### There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:

- CSS framework
- CSS float property
- CSS flexbox
- CSS grid

## JavaScript

### Functions 

#### A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

![Function](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1587882057-1.png)

#### ** Function Syntax **
#### A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

#### Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

#### The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

#### The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}


#### You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

#### You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
