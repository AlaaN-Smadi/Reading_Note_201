**What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”**

There are two common ways to store your tokens. The first is in localStorage and the second is in cookies. There is a lot of debate over which one is better with most people leaning toward cookies as they are more secure. Let’s go over the comparison between localStorage and cookies.

**Explain 3rd party cookies.**

Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting. These are usually used for online-advertising purposes and placed on a website through adding scripts or tags. A third-party cookie is accessible on any website that loads the third-party server’s code.

**How do pixel tags work?**

You add the tracking pixel using a code in your site’s HTML code or email, which contains an external link to the pixel server. When someone visits your website, the HTML code is processed by their browser, which follows the link and opens the hidden graphic. This action is identified and recorded in the server’s log files. This method allows for different information about the visitor to be transmitted.
