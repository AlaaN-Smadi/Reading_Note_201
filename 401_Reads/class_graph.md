## Graph 

### what is Graphs ?

**A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph**



- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.



**Connected A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge. In the visual above, this looks a lot more than what you are used to seeing. If you look closely at the different vertices of the graph, you will see that each node is connected to at least one other node or vertices. A Tree is a form of a connected graph. We will talk more about that in a bit.**

**Disconnected A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges. In the above visual, the disconnected graph shows that some nodes may not always be connected to other nodes or vertices of the graph. It is complelty possible to have standalone nodes or edges (also known as islands) in a graph data structure.**


### Acyclic vs Cyclic

- Acyclic Graph An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

- A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

- Adjacency Matrix An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix
