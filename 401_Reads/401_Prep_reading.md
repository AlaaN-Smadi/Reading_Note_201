### Common mistakes when start solving problems:

- You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it. No to start writing code as soon as possible.

- Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration. Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

### A simple set of steps to follow

1. Optimize the real code. It’s to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.

2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data. It’s very important that when you solve a problem manually, you recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem.

3. Read the problem completely twice. You want to make sure you completely understand the problem, a good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

4. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code. All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.

5. Optimize the manual steps. For this step you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

6. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code. Here you want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

## Act like you make $1000/hr

#### We should not spend your time without interest, everyone should decide what you do and how much time it takes to do it
#### Possibly you feel intimidated by all the programming terms before you even start to learn. Maybe the challenges seem solvable, but you can’t think of a way to solve them due to limited context. Once you start programming, you might spend hours looking for a bug and feel ready to quit. How can you get around these common pitfalls?

1. Be Persistent

#### The most important thing, whatever your situation, is to be persistent.

#### In the beginning when you research ways to solve a challenge, push yourself beyond your limit—at least a little bit more than usual. When you feel exhausted, drained, and ready give up, many times that’s when you finally figure it out. The moment where most people give up is the moment you need to keep going because this is when you improve. Everything uncomfortable is a gift so we can grow as individuals and strengthen our character.

#### The first few months are the most difficult. Don’t worry; I can tell you from experience it gets better. The hard work you put into it matters. I guarantee you’ll improve as time goes by.

2. Remember Your Goals

#### Another way to push yourself forward is to remember your goals. Why do you want to learn to code? Keep a list of your goals on your computer, in a notebook, or stuck to your wall. I like to make lists of my goals, then remind myself of them every morning. That sets my intention for the day and helps me focus on accomplishing them.


## 5 Whys, Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

#### When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis
#### You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

**How to Use the 5 Whys**

1. Ask “Why?” Four More Times, For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further “whys” in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you’ve just recorded.

2. Know When to Stop, You’ll know that you’ve revealed the root cause of the problem when asking “why” produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further.

3. Ask the First “Why?”, Ask your team why the problem is occurring.

4. Define the Problem, If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.

5. Assemble a Team, Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you’re trying to fix.

## How to think like a programmer

- You probably also wondered what does it mean, exactly, to think like a programmer? And how do you do it?? Essentially, it’s all about a more effective way for problem solving.

- If you’re interested in programming, you may well have seen this quote before: “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs
