**What are serverless functions?**

A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It’s then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier


**If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?**

Open the Functions page on the Lambda console.
Choose Create function.


**Describe how a CDN works**

At its core, a CDN is a network of servers linked together with the goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply, reliably, and securely as possible. In order to improve speed and connectivity, a CDN will place servers at the exchange points between different networks. These Internet exchange points (IXPs) are the primary locations where different Internet providers connect in order to provide each other access to traffic originating on their different networks. By having a connection to these high speed and highly interconnected locations, a CDN provider is able to reduce costs and transit times in high speed data delivery.

These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier


**Cloud Storage** : it is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service. It’s delivered on demand with just-in-time capacity and costs, and eliminates buying and managing your own data storage infrastructure.
