### Event Driven Applications


**Why is access control important?**

Because access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.

**Describe an application that would need access control.**

- If you have application and you need to give access to some of the users to do/reach something and the other uses can't.
- Then you will need to use access control to distinguish between the rights of users

**What is a role used for?**

The role determines which permissions the system grants to the user.

**Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?**

It can given and restricted easier than other type access control
and give a single user multiple roles

#### **Term**

**Authorization**: it’s a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features.


**Role Based Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person’s role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.


**Capabilities**: is the set of tasks or activities that a business function of an organization is potentially able to perform acquired skills at a certain level of performance available capacity, but only when it is needed
