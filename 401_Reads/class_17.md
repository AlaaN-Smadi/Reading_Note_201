### AWS: S3 and Lambda


**Describe “The Cloud”**

it’s a term used describe a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem.


**What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.


**What is auto-scaling?**

it is a process in the cloud computing that increase the capacity of the instances dynamicaally when our application need that.


**What is bandwidth?**

Bandwidth is the data transfer capacity of a computer network in bits per second (Bps). The term may also be used colloquially to indicate a person's capacity for tasks or deep thoughts at a point in time.


**How do cloud providers compute service costs?**

cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

### Term

**Server Instances** : it is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based. The instances are not linked with each other and can be controlled or managed separately.


**Containers** : it is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.


**Cloud Services** : a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.


**Cloud Architecture** : the technology components that are combined to build a cloud, where resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network.


**AWS** : Amazon web Services, it is a platform that provide a cloud computing services in general.


**EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku** : EC2/Beanstalk is AWS’s infrastructure solution for deploying software. Heroku is built off of these services and is more user friendly in my opinion.
