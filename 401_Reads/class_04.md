## Data Modeling

#### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development


1. You receive fast feedback.
2. TDD creates a detailed specification.
3. TDD reduces time spent on rework.
4. You spend less time in the debugger.
5. Writing the tests first requires you to really consider what do you want from the code.


#### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- If you have some work you need to do repeatedly for many tests, you can use beforeEach and afterEach.

- beforeEach() is run before each test in a describe afterEach() is run after each test in a describe


#### What is one downside of Test Driven Development : (Links to an external site.)

**the actual database or external file is never tested directly by TDD (only production code can test it)**


#### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes? (Links to an external site.)

**ES6 classes is like a container that holds the constructor and the methods associated with your instantiated object.**

#### Why REST?

- Easy to Learn and Implement
- REST Makes your Application More Scalable
- Faster Data Interchange Format
- REST is Flexibile
- No state
- Caching is Easier with REST


#### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- functional programming: Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions.

- object-oriented programming OOP: is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

- class: is a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes.

- super: The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object’s parent.

- this: The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

- Test Driven Development TDD: is to simply start working on code by writing automated tests BEFORE writing the code that is being tested.

- Jest: is an open-source testing framework built on JavaScript, designed majorly to work with React and React Native based web applications.

- Continuous Integration CI: is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

- REST: REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that handles the client-server relationship, with the purpose of aiming for speed and performance by using re-usable components.

- Data Model: an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities
