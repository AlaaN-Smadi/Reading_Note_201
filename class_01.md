#### HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages.

#### The <HTML> is a markup language which is used by the browser to manipulate text, images and other content to display it in required format.

#### Tags in HTML: Tags are one of the most important part in an HTML Document. HTML uses some predefined tags which tells the browser about content display property, that is how to display a particular given content. For Example, to create a paragraph, one must use the paragraph tags(<p> </p>) and to insert an image one must use the img tags(<img />).

- **There are generally two types of tags in HTML:**

1. **Paired Tags: These tags come in pairs. That is they have both opening(< >) and closing(</ >) tags.**

2. **Singular Tags: These tags do not required to be closed.
Below is an example of (<b>) tag in HTML, which tells the browser to bold the text inside it.**

- a powerful collection of only 5 data types that can easily be combined
- strong typing, yet without declarations
- no limitations (such as max int), apart from sheer exhaustion of memory
- refinements to support top-down programming
- nesting by indentation
- programs typically one fourth or one fifth the size of the equivalent Pascal or C.

### features of the environment:

- no need for files: procedures and functions and global variables remain after logging out
- one consistent face is shown to the user at all times, whether executing commands, editing, or entering input to a program
- generalized undo mechanism.
