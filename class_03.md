#### In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

#### The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

### Parts of box :

- Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
- Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
- Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

#### In order to set the width and height of an element correctly in all browsers, you need to know how the box model works.

#### When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.


## JavaScript

#### Variables 

#### JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

### Data Types

#### JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

#### In programming, text values are called text strings.

#### JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

#### Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

#### If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.


## Loops

#### Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

#### switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match)
